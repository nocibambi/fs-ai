# Machine learning practice challenge: Global Terrorist Database
In this practice challenge I implemented and adjusted for models to predict the identity of responsible terrorist groups based on incidents' characteristics.

## Data
I trained the models on data from the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/).

## Used techniques
* python scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
* Decision trees, KNN
